This presentation introduces decentralised exchanges (DEXs) because many users currently rely on centralised exchanges (CEXs). In my opinion, CEXs are not particularly beneficial for regular users if they consider Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. I can identify instances where CEXs are useful for companies and individuals who claim to be traders. This presentation is designed to last 15 minutes.

The presentation was held at the Dublin Bitcoiners meetup in September 2025.
